##### Pull Requests

When the work on a feature/bug-fix branch is completed, a pull request (PR) should be opened to next-release.

##### PR Titles

A similar convention with the commit messages applies to PR titles. Avoid giving too much detail on the PR titles, maximum of 4-5 words would be enough to explain the purpose of the PR.

```ssh
<type>(scope): <pr summary>
```

##### PR Descriptions

Include the purpose of the PR, the changes you made, and the expected behavior to PR descriptions. Please fill the PR template, you can feel free to add more sections.

##### Work on local

For working on your local project you should add/replace in local project package.json file 
```json
"@deflywallet/connect": "version"
```

to 

```json
"@deflywallet/connect": "file:../connect"
```

here an example of package.json file

```code
  "dependencies": {
    "@deflywallet/connect": "C:\\dev\\wallet-connect",
    "algosdk": "1.18.1",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1"
    ...
  },
```

After doing this, you can run `npm run dev` and in this way, you can see the changes you have made to the package simultaneously.
